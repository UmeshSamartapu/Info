newfile = untracked
if we change content in file = modified
file redy to be commited = staged

git add <file name>
when we add file => staged
git commit -m "your message"
commit them => unchanged

after commit we will see that 
we are few steps ahead to our GItHub repo so, we push new files to git 
{files from local to remote}
git push -u origin main

by default remote repo name is => "origin" we can also change it
